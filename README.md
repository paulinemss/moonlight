### What is Moonlight? 

Moonlight is an application that allows you to stay connected with the lunar cycle. Each day, the app displays the current moon phase, and gives the user self-care and spiritual prompts in relation to that specific phase. 

As a homepage, Moonlight displays the current time and date, local weather forecast, and enables the user to add their own daily to-dos. 

### Portfolio Project

Moonlight is a React web app built and designed by [Pauline Mass√©](https://github.com/paulinemss). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
